### Purpose

This is a repository containing a Shiny App as a submission for HW08 assignment for STAT 547.

It contains an excerpt of University of Maryland's [India Human Development Survey (IHDS)](https://ihds.umd.edu), which is a dataset that is relevant to my doctoral research topic on energy policy in India. The folder 'IHDS' contains a Shiny App that excerpts IHDS data for income, vehicle ownership, electricity access, and geographic region. The app generates a histogram of income distributed by the other variables of interest.

Note that the folder 'bcl' contains a Shiny App that was seeded to this repo. Disregard this, as it is not part of the HW08 assignment submission.
